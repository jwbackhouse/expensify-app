# expensify-app

Single-user expense-logging app, built in May 2020 as part of 'The Complete React Developer Course' by Andrew Mead on Udemy

Uses Redux for local state management and Firebase RTDB for data storage.

Potential features to add:
1) Buy a custom domain and configure it with heroku (or use on subdomain on an existing site)
2) Convert sort-by arrows to only show one (pointing right if not selected) - as at https://scl-expensify.herokuapp.com/dashboard
